# MEGA-Registration

## Description
A little app I made for my friend for letting his employees register those who attended the MEGA event. This app was being used during MEGA 360 event in Mega Mall Kazan.

## Technologies stack
The goal was to make a decent working app with 2 screens in a half of a day. So the technologies I've used were the following:
- Swift 3
- MVC architecture (native, simple, yet powerful architecture pattern in right hands)
- RealmSwift (I use Realm a lot in my projects, that's why it was faster for me to include it to make my models cachable in no time)
- XlsxReaderWriter (The app had to create an .xlsx file from the database and this was the only library I found for working with Excel files in iOS)
